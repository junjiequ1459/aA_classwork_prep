### What's Next
* Upon graduating Boocamp Prep you'll receive an email to book your tech interview
  * Note: The link will not work unless you've already submitted a full-time application
* Apply for full-time cohort on <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">https://www.appacademy.io/</a>
* Apply for tech interview **when you feel ready**
* Remember to dress up a bit and look well-presented for both interviews

### Technical Interview

* General Format
  * 45 - 50min total via video chat and coding live share platform
  * 3 Questions - 15 min/question (no rollover minutes)
    * easy-medium, medium, hard
  * Pair programming on hard question
* How to prep for tech interview?
  * Redo all Bootcamp Prep problem sets, practice and assessment problems
  * Time yourself to not exceed 15min per problem
  * Practice explaining your thinking process and code out loud
  * Don't spam mocha! Check your code by walking through it line-by-line with an example!
  * After you feel you've mastered all Bootcamp Prep problems, **book your mock tech**
* Mock Tech
  * <a href="https://github.com/appacademy/bootcamp-prep-live-curriculum/blob/master/other/mock_interviews.md">Book your Mock Tech Link</a>
  * Mock tech is around 1hr (15min/question + 15min feedback at the end)
  * If you find the mock tech rather "easy", don't let your guard down and continue practicing! The actual tech interview might be harder than your mock tech
  * Don't book your mock tech on consecutive days - book it a few days apart
* How to approach each problem?
  * Read and understand problem
  * Look at examples
    * Are there any edge cases?
  * Re-state the question in your own words
  * Give a high level strategy
  * Write the code
  * Walk through your code line-by-line with an example or two
    * This is great to help you catch any bugs!
* **Make sure you have a solid understanding of foundations!**
  * Data types and basic understanding of how code is executed
  * Strings
    * Loop through each character in a string
    * Basic string manipulations: removing characters, adding characters, slicing, splitting, etc
    * Difference between strings and arrays
  * Arrays
    * Common methods
    * How to loop through an array
    * Recognize when to use an array to store our data
  * Objects
    * How to loop through an object
    * How to check if a key exists in an object
    * Recognize when to use an object to store our data
  * Conditionals
    * Know when to use only an `if..`
    * Know when to use `if..else..`
    * Know when to use `if..else if..`
    * Know when to use `if..` `if..`
  * Early returns
    * Know when we can return early from a function
  * Loops
    * Loop basics - what kind of looping conditional logic to set
    * Recognize when we should loop from the beginning
      * ie: `leastCommonMultiple`
    * Recognize when we should loop in reverse
      * ie: `greatestCommonFactor`
    * Recognize when to use a nested loop
    * Recognize when to NOT use nested loop
    * How variables behave inside vs outside a loop
      * Do I want the values of my variables to reset?
  * Arrays vs Objects
    * Understand the difference between arrays vs objects
    * Know when to use which data structure to manage our data
    * Basic pros and cons for array and objects
* **Putting it all together - Know how to take all the basics and use them to problem solve**
* More materials
  * If you want more practice feel free to use <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/latest/my-languages">Codewars</a> as an external resource
  * For quality practice aim to do problems that are `6kyu` or `5kyu`
    * `5kyu` problems are tougher than `6kyu`
    * These are closer to the range of difficulty of tech interview

### Behavorial Interview

* General Format
  * 20 - 30min total via video chat
* How to prep for behavorial (aka non-technical) interview?
  * Refer to `W4D1` Github notes
